    <!--
        It allows you to display different pictures
        for different devices or screen sizes.

        The <picture> element contains one or more
        <source> elements, each referring to different
        images through the srcset attribute. 
        This way the browser can choose the image that 
        best fits the current view and/or device.

    <!--
        NOTE: The browser will use the first <source> element
        with matching attribute values, and ignore any following <source> elements.

        When to use the Picture Element :-
        1. Bandwidth
            If you have a small screen or device, 
            it is not necessary to load a large image file. 
            The browser will use the first <source> element 
            with matching attribute values,and ignore any of the following elements.

        2. Format Support
            Some browsers or devices may not support all image formats.
            By using the <picture> element, you can add images of all formats,
            and the browser will use the first format it recognizes,
            and ignore any of the following elements
